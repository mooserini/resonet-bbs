# ResoNET BBS

ResoNET BBS is the community board of the Resonant Mirror world, live at [reso.getadongle.com](https://reso.getadongle.com). It is a fork of [WolfBBS](https://github.com/Awassee/wolfbbs) by Sean Heiney, and keeps WolfBBS's SSH-first ANSI board, web companion, IRC bridge and doors underneath its own identity.

## Running this fork

This fork's bootstrap runs the `install.sh` next to it, not upstream's. Clone this repo, then:

```bash
bash bootstrap.sh
```

Safe any time: `--status`, `--doctor`, `--logs`, `--dry-run`, `--start`, `--restart`, `--repair`. Destructive steps (overwriting `.env`, deleting data, removing the install folder) require typing `WIPE`. See [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for Cloudflare Tunnel, email, and network notes.

## Forking this fork

Everything the public sees is named in [`identity.env`](identity.env). Change `BBS_NAME` and `BBS_REPO` there first, or run `bash bootstrap.sh`: on a fork that still calls itself WolfBBS, it asks for a name before anything else. The live board name can be changed later in `/admin/config`.

Internals keep the WolfBBS name on purpose, for provenance: the `WOLFBBS_*` settings, the `wolfbbs` Docker project and database volume, the binaries, and the Go module.

## About the name

WolfBBS is Sean Heiney's project, MIT licensed. This fork keeps the original copyright notice in [LICENSE](LICENSE) and credits WolfBBS wherever the software itself is described. The rest of this README is WolfBBS's own documentation. Its one-line `curl` installers point at upstream WolfBBS, not at this fork.

## Product Snapshot

| Lane | Primary surfaces | Why this lane exists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Caller | SSH ANSI, `/today`, `/boards`, `/chat`, `/doors` | keeps daily interaction fast, social, and game-friendly |
| Sysop | `/admin/setup`, `/admin/launch`, `/admin/config`, `/admin/ops` | gives operators a direct launch and maintenance control plane |
| Community | `/events`, `/challenges`, `/clubhouse`, IRC bridge | creates repeat visit loops and shared momentum |
| Distribution | `bootstrap.sh`, `install.sh`, release tarballs | supports quick install, upgrade, repair, and uninstall lifecycle |

## Start In 3 Minutes

1. Paste one command (Linux): `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awassee/wolfbbs/main/bootstrap.sh | bash`
2. Sign in to `/admin/setup` using the bootstrap sysop from installer output.
3. Validate caller surfaces in this order: SSH, `/boards`, `/chat`, `/doors`, `/scores`.

## Why WolfBBS

WolfBBS is built for operators who want the feel of a classic board without the usual setup pain.

- `Retro caller experience`: ANSI/TUI menus, message boards, private mail, doors, newscan, and classic operator views.
- `Modern access layer`: web companion, admin console, live chat, IRC bridge, password reset, health checks, and packaging.
- `Low-friction operations`: paste-and-run bootstrap, guided installer menu, upgrade and repair commands, Docker-first deployment.
- `Community-ready`: callers, moderators, sysops, guest tours, directory, bulletins, one-liners, scores, and public-facing discovery surfaces.

## What You Get

## Best Fit

WolfBBS is a good fit if you want to:

- host a hobbyist retro board with modern onboarding
- run an internal community hub with SSH, web, and IRC access
- launch a retro-gaming or door-game focused community
- experiment with BBS-style interaction without building a stack from scratch

## Quick install (Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awassee/wolfbbs/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

This path does not require `git` to be installed first.

## Quick install (macOS)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awassee/wolfbbs/main/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -- --install-brew
```

This path also works without a preinstalled `git` client.

## Choose Your Path

| If you want to... | Use this | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| get WolfBBS running as fast as possible | bootstrap installer | installs dependencies, downloads the latest packaged app bundle, and starts the stack |
| inspect or modify the code locally | clone the repo | best for operators who also want a working tree |
| download a packaged bundle | GitHub Release tarball | best for controlled installs and offline handoff |

## Install In Minutes

Source checkout flow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awassee/wolfbbs.git wolfbbs
cd wolfbbs
bash install.sh
```

Packaged app bundle flow:

```bash
tar -xzf wolfbbs_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz
cd wolfbbs_<version>_<os>_<arch>
bash install.sh --yes
```

The paste-and-go bootstrap path now aims for the same bundle-first experience. It should not need `git` for a normal install.

Build clean `v2.1.9` distro bundles locally:

```bash
scripts/package-dist.sh --clean --version v2.1.9 \
  --platform linux/amd64 --platform linux/arm64 \
  --platform darwin/amd64 --platform darwin/arm64
```

## Which Surface Should You Use?

| Role | Best starting point | What it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sysop | `/admin/setup` | identity, safety baseline, bootstrap actions, first health checks |
| moderator | `/chat`, `/boards`, `/admin/chat` | live moderation and day-to-day community visibility |
| caller | `/today`, SSH, `/boards`, `/chat`, `/doors` | the actual board experience plus the fastest daily brief |
| visitor | `/connect`, `/tour`, `/help` | orientation before committing to an account |

## First Launch Checklist

After install, WolfBBS prints the connection summary and bootstrap sysop credentials. The recommended first-run flow is:

1. Open `/admin/setup` to complete identity, safety, and bootstrap checks.
2. Open `/admin/launch` to see the operator launch verdict and direct next actions.
3. Open `/admin/config` to tune site text, runtime flags, services, and operator preferences.
4. Seed default boards and confirm the mailbot bootstrap action.
5. Create at least one non-sysop user or moderator from `/admin/users`.
6. Schedule at least one event in `/admin/events`, then verify `/events` and `/events/recaps`.
7. Configure an active season in `/admin/challenges`, then verify `/challenges` and `/clubhouse`.
8. Run upgrade safety checks in `/admin/upgrade-safety` and validate artifacts in `/admin/backups`.
9. Connect over SSH and verify the caller-facing ANSI flow.
10. Open `/boards`, `/chat`, `/doors`, and `/scores` to confirm the public experience.

The installer also writes:

- `<prefix>/FIRST_STEPS.txt` with exact URLs, commands, and next actions
- `<prefix>/SERVICE_STATUS.txt` after `bash install.sh --status`

Default local endpoints:

- SSH: `ssh localhost -p 2222`
- Web admin: `http://localhost:8080/admin`
- Web chat: `http://localhost:8080/chat`
- IRC: `localhost:6667`
- IRC TLS: `localhost:6697` when enabled

## Daily Operator Commands

```bash
bash install.sh --status
bash install.sh --doctor
bash install.sh --port-audit
bash install.sh --debug-bundle
bash install.sh --repair
bash install.sh --start
bash install.sh --stop
bash install.sh --restart
bash install.sh --logs
bash install.sh --upgrade
bash install.sh --rapid-upgrade
bash install.sh --uninstall --purge --yes
bash install.sh --clean-uninstall --yes
```

In-BBS upgrade:

```bash
bash install.sh --repair
```

`--repair` backfills in-app upgrade env wiring on older installs. Then in the SSH main menu press `/` and enter `/app upgrade`.

## What Success Looks Like In 15 Minutes

You should be able to say yes to all of these:

1. I can sign into `/admin`.
2. `/admin/setup` and `/admin/config` reflect my board name and host.
3. SSH login works and the ANSI menu feels right.
4. `/chat` works and mirrors to IRC if IRC is enabled.
5. `/boards` has seeded or starter content.
6. `/doors` and `/scores` render without dead ends.
7. `bash install.sh --doctor` returns a usable health report.
