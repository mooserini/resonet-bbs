# WolfBBS Troubleshooting

Use this when the installer ran but the product still feels wrong.

## First Commands

Run these before changing random settings:

```bash
bash install.sh --status
bash install.sh --doctor
bash install.sh --port-audit
bash install.sh --debug-bundle
bash install.sh --repair
bash install.sh --logs
```

Useful generated files:

- `<prefix>/FIRST_STEPS.txt`
- `<prefix>/SERVICE_STATUS.txt`
- `<prefix>/WOLFBBS_DIAGNOSTICS_<timestamp>.txt` from `bash install.sh --debug-bundle`

## Symptom Routing

### I am not sure what to do next after install

- Open `FIRST_STEPS.txt`
- Open `/admin/launch`
- Read [START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md)
- Finish `/admin/setup`

### Web UI is up but the board feels empty

- Open `/admin/setup?step=4`
- seed default boards
- ensure the mailbot account
- create a real caller in `/admin/users`

### Chat works strangely or IRC users complain

- test `/chat`
- check `/admin/chat`
- review `/status` and `/admin/system`
- verify the expected IRC port is exposed

### SSH works but caller experience still feels incomplete

- walk the ANSI flow yourself
- confirm boards, mail, chat, files, and doors from the main menu
- compare against [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md)

### Installer or status output shows warnings

- warnings are not always blockers
- fix blockers first
- if warnings are intentional, document them before launch

### Admin saves fail with "read-only mode"

Read-only maintenance mode blocks every admin save. Open `/admin/config` as a sysop and press **Turn off read-only mode** in the banner at the top.

On older builds without that button, or if the web UI is down, turn it off in the database and restart the web service, which only reads settings at startup:

```bash
docker exec wolfbbs-postgres-1 psql -U wolfbbs -d wolfbbs -c "update system_settings set value='false', updated_at=now() where key='site.read_only'"
docker restart wolfbbs-web-1
```

The first command should print `UPDATE 1`. If you changed `POSTGRES_USER` or `POSTGRES_DB`, use those values.

### Docker or Compose looks broken

- make sure Docker is installed
- make sure the daemon is reachable for the current user
- rerun `bash install.sh --doctor`
- if needed, rerun the bootstrap installer

## Common Cases

### `git` is missing

That is supported on the bootstrap path. Use:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Awassee/wolfbbs/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

The installer downloads a GitHub archive when `git` is unavailable or broken.

### I changed ports or proxies and now I do not trust the install

Run:

```bash
bash install.sh --doctor
bash install.sh --status
```

Then verify `/admin/setup`, `/status`, and `/admin/system`.

### I want a clean rebuild without re-learning the product

Run:

```bash
bash install.sh --repair
```

Then use `FIRST_STEPS.txt` again.
