# Admin Interface (MVP)

## Scope
This version ships a read/write web-first control panel with role-aware routes and DB-backed state for boards, file areas, gateway settings, outbound-mail policy, and admin audit entries.

## Roles
- `user`: standard read-only web companion access.
- `moderator`: can manage message moderation queues and abuse flags.
- `sysop`: full system control.
- `admin`: legacy alias that normalizes to `sysop` for backward compatibility.

## Primary Panels
- Users
  - list/search by handle
  - disable/enable
  - ban/unban
  - password reset (sysop-only)
  - role assignment
  - show last login and session/IP history
  - optional audit notes
- Boards
  - create/edit/delete board metadata
  - toggle lock/permissions per board
  - moderate posts: delete/edit reason, lock thread, move post thread
  - report queue and clear actions
- Private Mail
  - metadata-only audit view
  - outbound rate-limit status
  - disable outbound for user
- Files
  - create/delete file areas
  - index files from area paths (SHA-256 + DIZ/NFO description extraction)
  - browse/search indexed files by area/query/tags
  - per-file ratings and saved filters
  - per-user download queue management
  - issue temporary download tickets for `/gateway?download=<token>`
  - bounded upload intake with optional env-driven policy/scanner hook
- Gateways
  - SMTP relay settings, allow/deny list, global and per-user caps
  - web gateway SSRF blocklist and timeout policy
  - AI gateway base URL validation with private/loopback override only via explicit env opt-in
- Chat
  - channel list and lock/unlock state
  - create channels
  - kick/ban/mute and log visibility
  - moderation log table
- Doors
  - enable/disable each door
  - configure daily turns, time-bank caps, retention, output/run limits
  - per-door role overrides
  - reset door leaderboards
  - usage stats and door event logs
- Events + Recaps
  - schedule one-time/recurring events
  - collect caller event check-ins
  - publish post-event recaps with attendance and highlights
  - expose recap feed at `/events/recaps`
- Challenges + Shared Goals
  - define active seasonal challenge windows
  - configure board/chat/door scoring weights
  - define clubhouse goals tied to boards and doors
  - track caller contributions from `/clubhouse`
- Upgrade Safety
  - pre-upgrade trust checklist from install + runtime signals
  - operator recommendations before upgrade windows
- Backup Browser
  - inspect backup artifacts (service snapshots, menu backups, offline packets)
  - run lightweight validation and triage warnings
- System
  - `/admin/setup` is the primary first-run setup UX
  - setup grouped as a 4-step wizard:
    - Step 1: Identity
    - Step 2: Safety
    - Step 3: Experience Flags
    - Step 4: Bootstrap + Health
  - installer flags are optional automation overrides; normal setup is UI-first
  - motd/announcement editor
  - runtime feature toggles (read-only, on-ramp, guest tour, discover)
  - runtime services profile (ACS strict, telnet/ws/wss, trusted proxies, content listeners, ActivityPub, connector commands)
  - runtime service values persist in system settings and apply on startup/restart
  - ANSI menu runtime editor (HJSON file selection, validation, save)
  - WFC-style dashboard with session/channel/online metrics
  - node diagnostics endpoint for persisted node/caller state
  - setup/install verification panel
  - runtime error log panel
  - logs, metrics, health check endpoints
  - auditable admin action log

## Session and Security
- Cookie-based session, `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Strict`.
- CSRF protection on mutating POST endpoints.
- Optional ACS gate for `/admin/*` via `WOLFBBS_ACS_ADMIN` (evaluated after role checks).
- Optional 2FA (TOTP) for sysop accounts.
- Audit trail required for all sysop/admin writes with actor, target, action, reason.
- User settings updates (password/2FA/preferences) also require CSRF.
- Admin file uploads enforce `WOLFBBS_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` and may be vetoed by `WOLFBBS_UPLOAD_POLICY_HOOK`.
- AI gateway calls reject private/loopback targets unless `WOLFBBS_GATEWAY_AI_ALLOW_PRIVATE=1` is set intentionally.

## Verified Accounts
- Verified means one of two honest things: a confirmed recovery email, or 2FA active with recovery codes explicitly acknowledged via the "I've saved my codes" button in `/settings`.
- Turning on 2FA alone does not verify. Fresh code sets (re-setup, regen, admin 2FA reset) always start unacknowledged.
- Disabling 2FA or regenerating codes recomputes Verified, but never revokes verification granted another way (bootstrap sysop, admin hand-verify) — only the codes flow's own grant.
- Lockout rule of thumb: no confirmed email + lost password + lost codes and authenticator = host CLI (`bootstrap.sh --reset-2fa`) or sysop rescue only. Nudge callers to confirm an email before they need it.

## Read-only Mode Toggle
- Runtime toggle keeps all mutating writes disabled, including admin saves.
- In read-only mode, destructive operations return 403 with a short reason.
- To leave read-only mode, open `/admin/config` as a sysop and press **Turn off read-only mode** in the banner at the top. That is the one admin write allowed while read-only is on (it still needs a CSRF token and the admin role), and it is recorded in `/admin/audit` as `exit_read_only`.
- The setting lives in `system_settings` (`site.read_only`) and overrides `WOLFBBS_READ_ONLY`. See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for recovering from the database if the web UI is unavailable.
