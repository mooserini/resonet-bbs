# Operations Guide

This is the day-two operator runbook for WolfBBS after install and first launch.

## Daily checks

Run these first:

```bash
bash install.sh --status
bash install.sh --doctor
```

Review these pages:

- `/admin/system`
- `/admin/audit`
- `/admin/ops`
- `/status`

- `<prefix>/SERVICE_STATUS.txt`

## Common operator jobs

### Update the board safely

Published update:

```bash
bash install.sh --upgrade
```

Local rebuild from the current checkout:

```bash
bash install.sh --rapid-upgrade
```

### Recover from a bad state

```bash
bash install.sh --status
bash install.sh --doctor
bash install.sh --repair
bash install.sh --logs
```

### Stop or restart services

```bash
bash install.sh --stop
bash install.sh --start
bash install.sh --restart
```

## First things to check when users report problems

### "I cannot log in"

- check `/admin/system`
- check `/admin/errors`
- run `bash install.sh --doctor`

### "The web app feels broken"

- check `/healthz`
- check `/readyz`
- check `bash install.sh --logs`

### "SSH works but the browser does not"

- verify the configured web port in `bash install.sh --status`
- verify reverse proxy or hostname settings in `/admin/config`

### "Chat is weird"

- test `/chat`
- if IRC is enabled, verify the IRC bridge separately
- check `/admin/chat`

## Weekly operator rhythm

- review `/admin/audit`
- review `/admin/users`
- refresh bulletin or board starter content
- verify doors and scores still feel alive
- run upgrade or rapid-upgrade when needed

## Release discipline

Before packaging a release, prefer the one-command QA path:

```bash
scripts/release.sh --version vX.Y.Z --full-qa
```

That path now runs smoke verification, browser and terminal functional checks, manual acceptance auto mode, and the security audit before packaging.

When you want the same readiness bar without tagging a release, use:

```bash
scripts/feature-complete.sh
```

That wrapper runs the full feature-complete gate in one command:

- `go test ./...`
- `scripts/verify.sh --fast`
- `scripts/qa-functional.sh --with-web-e2e --with-manual-auto`
- `scripts/verify.sh --smoke`
- `scripts/security-audit.sh`

After a public release, switch to the triage loop in [POST_RELEASE_TRIAGE.md](POST_RELEASE_TRIAGE.md) before starting the next feature tranche.

## Backups and restore

Everything that can't be rebuilt from the repo is the database (the `wolfbbs_pgdata` volume) and `<prefix>/.env`. Back both up with:

```bash
bash bootstrap.sh --backup
```

This writes `<prefix>/backups/<timestamp>/` (folder mode 700) containing `database.dump` (pg_dump custom format), a copy of `.env`, and a `MANIFEST.txt` with the app commit and checksum. The newest 14 backups are kept; set `WOLFBBS_BACKUP_KEEP` to change that. Settings saved in `/admin/config` and `/admin/gateways` live in the database, so they're included.

To roll back:

```bash
bash bootstrap.sh --restore <prefix>/backups/<timestamp>
```

Restore asks you to type `WIPE`, takes a fresh safety backup of the current database first, stops the app containers, restores, and starts them again. The live `.env` is left alone (its database password must match the running Postgres volume); the backup's `env` copy is there if you are rebuilding from scratch. Copy the `backups` folder somewhere off this machine now and then; a backup on the same disk doesn't survive a dead disk.
